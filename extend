we have a React app with styled-components, and we're generating a few theme colors via the <ThemeProvider>.

We're currently outputting 3 buttons, styled with the CSS provided here. They're all using the "base color".

We could use properties - like danger - to conditionally change the background-color here, but we can also "extend" a component's styles.

Let's create a `ButtonDanger` constant, and we'll make it extend the Button component. Button.extend 

This new component inherits all the styles from the main Button, and we can now set the background color to props.theme.danger.
